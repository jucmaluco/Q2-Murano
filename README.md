# Q2-Murano

<p> The objetive of this repository is to answer questions and analyse the usage of Git under various circumstances. </p>

<h2>A) Example of commands you can run with git: </h2>

<h3>1. Git Clone </h3>
<p> When a user utilizes this command, they will create a copy of a remote repository on their local machine. The command will download all the files, branches, and commit history of the repository.
<p>
When using git clone, users can pull and push their changes to the original repository. </p>
<P> Example code usage: </P>
<i> git clone "repository_url" </i>

<h3>2. Git Branch </h3>
<p> Using branches, users can create isolated workspaces for developing features, fixing bugs, and experiment withoug affecting the original code. </p>
<p> When someone creates an original git repository, they create a "main" branch. When creating additional branches, users are technically creating pointers to specific commits of the previous main branch, and therefore creating a new timeline of its own. </p>
<p> If the user wishes to do so in the future, it is possible to merge branches with the <strong> git merge </strong> command. </p>
<P> Example code usage: </P>
<i> git branch name-of-the-branch </i>

<h3> 3. Git Commit </h3>
<p> Perhaps one of the most used Git commands, <strong> Git Commit </strong> is used to save his staged changes to the local Git repository as a new version. </p>
<p> Every commit includes a unique ID (hash) and a message describing the changes. </p>
<p> As mentioned, commit only saves the changes that have been staged. To stage a change, user needs to use the <strong> git add . </strong> command. </p>
<p> Also, commiting one's change is only part of the work that needs to be done. If the user wishes to upload the changes commited to a remote repository, the <strong> git push </strong> command shall be used.</p>
<p> Example code usage> </p>
<i> git commit -m "Comment about changes" </i>

<h2>B)Solutions for having a shared library used and edited by two different projects.</h2>
<p> Now, it's time to analyze a situation where two distinct projects within the same company use and modify the same library on a daily basis. A solution is needed to ensure that the library remains synchronized with respect to each of the projects.</p> 
<p> As has been discussed, turning the library into a Git repository and creating two different branches—one for each project—will allow each project to have its own timeline and to build according to their specific needs. </p>

<h2>C) Visualizing code made in past commits, and problems generated by editing past commits directly. </h2>

<p> Now, a solution is needed for when someone wants to view the code submitted on a past commit. To do so, there is a simple command: </p>
<i> git checkout (commit-hash) </i>

<p> To discover the hash of the commit in question, the following code can be ran: </p>
<i> git log --oneline </i>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16dbafe8-9e07-4322-a156-eac2636a9495)

<p> Now, we have a situation where the user created a new commit (5) from the past commit (2), instead of returning to the present commit (4). </p>
<p>To visualize the mistake made, the user can run the following command: </p>
<i> git log --graph --oneline </i>

<p>Now, the user can run the following code to return to the desired commit (commit 4) and import the changes made to commit 2 (that created commit 5): </p>

<i> git checkout (commit4-hash) </i>

<i> git cherry-pick (commit5-hash) </i>
